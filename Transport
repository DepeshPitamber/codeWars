*
The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40.

If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total.

if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

        var carCost = 40;
